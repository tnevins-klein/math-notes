# Tani's Big Pile of Math Notes

This is my collection of math notes. I hope they are helpful and informative, but no guarentees are given in that regard. They were made in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and are probably best viewed there. If you're feeling Calculus-enthused, you could start at [[Integration]], or if you're in the mood for some imagination, try [[Euler's Formula]].

Cheers!
