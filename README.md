# Tani's Big Pile of Math Notes

This is my collection of math notes. These are very quickly and losely thrown together, mainly to test out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and are probably best viewed there. I hope they are helpful and informative, but no guarentees are given in that regard. If you're feeling Calculus-enthused, you could start at [Integration](Calculus/Fundamentals/Integration.md), or if you're in the mood for some imagination, try [Euler's Formula](Algebra/Euler's%20Formula.md).

Cheers!
