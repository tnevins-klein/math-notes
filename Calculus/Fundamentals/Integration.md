An integral, losely, can be interpreted as the *[Signed Area](Signed%20Area.md)* under a curve for the point $x = a$ to $x = b$. More rigourously, integrals are defined with a [|limit](Limit.md) of a [Reimann Sum](Reimann%20Sum.md), that is:
$$\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} 
f(x_i^*) \Delta x$$
[Differentiation](Differentiation.md) and integration are linked by the [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](Fundamental%20Theorem%20of%20Calculus.md).
