An integral, losely, can be interpreted as the *[[Signed Area]]* under a curve for the point $x = a$ to $x = b$. More rigourously, integrals are defined with a [[Limit||limit]] of a [[Reimann Sum]], that is:
$$\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} 
f(x_i^*) \Delta x$$
[[Differentiation]] and integration are linked by the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]].
