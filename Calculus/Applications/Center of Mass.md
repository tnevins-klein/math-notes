For a rod with linear density $p(x)$, the center of mass $\bar{x}$ is given by:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\int_a^b x p(x)dx}{\int_a^b p(x)dx}
$$
For some surface bounded by two lines, the x-axis and a function $f(x)$:
$$\bar{x} = \frac{\int_a^b x f(x)dx}{\int_a^b f(x)dx} \text{ and } \bar{y} = \frac{\int_a^b y \ \ell(y)dy}{\int_a^b f(x) dx}$$
where $\ell(y)$ is the vertical distance of the region.
