A **vector space** over some [field](Field.md) $\mathbb{F}$ is a set $V$, together with the binary operations of [addition](Algebra/Abstract/Addition.md) and [scalar multiplication](Algebra/Abstract/Scalar%20Multiplication.md), satifying the following properties:

> [!NOTE] Axoims on Vector Spaces
> $u + v = v + u\ \forall v \in V$, called **communitivity**
> $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\ \forall u,v,w\in V$, called **associativity**
> $\dots$
