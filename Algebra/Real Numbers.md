The real numbers, denoted $\mathbb{R}$, are the union of the [rationals](Algebra/Rational%20Numbers.md) and [irrationals](Algebra/Irrational%20Numbers.md). They include the [integers](Algebra/Integers.md), fractions such as $\frac{1}{2}$ and irrational and [trancendental numbers](Algebra/Transcendental%20Numbers.md) such as $e$ and $\pi$.
