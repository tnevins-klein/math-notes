Rationals, denoted $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$ (for [reals](Real%20Numbers.md) minus [rationals](Rational%20Numbers.md)), are numbers that are not [rational](Rational%20Numbers.md). Alternatively, they are numbers whose decimal representation does not eventually repeat or terminate. Examples include $e$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\varphi$, and $\pi$.
