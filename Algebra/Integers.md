The integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}$, are the set of [natural numbers](Algebra/Natural%20Numbers.md) together with with their additive inverses and a $0$ element.

$$\mathbb{Z} = \dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\dots$$

The sets $\mathbb{Z}^+$ (also known as the [naturals](Natural%20Numbers.md)) and $\mathbb{Z}^-$ denote the positive and negative integers respectively:
$$
\begin{align}
	\mathbb{Z}^+ &= 1, 2,3,\dots \\
	\mathbb{Z}^- &= -1,-2,-3,\dots
\end{align}
$$
