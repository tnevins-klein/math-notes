Complex numbers are numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i = \sqrt{-1}$. Numbers purely of the form $bi$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, are called *imaginary*. Complex numbers form a [[Algebra/Abstract/Field|field]].

> [!NOTE] Operations on the Complex Numbers
> Let $a + bi, c + di \in \mathbb{C}$.
> **Complex addition** is defined component-wise.
> $$(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + b) + (c + d)i$$
> **Complex multiplication** is defined by the normal rules of multiplying binomials, keeping in mind that $i^2 = -1$ by definition.
> $$(a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i$$
